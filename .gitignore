# CSharp Server SDK files
# Keep txt.metas and cs.metas, because Unity won't generate these.
# The release packaging process adds the CSharp Server SDK files to the package without opening Unity, so .metas must exist.
# Unity treats tarbell packages as immutable, so it won't generate metas even after the package is installed.
